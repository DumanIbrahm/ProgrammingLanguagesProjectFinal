## Design of Our Language
Hehe is a programming language encompassing fundamental features such as variable declarations, assignments, arithmetic and logical operations, conditional statements, iterative constructs, function definitions, and input/output capabilities.

```
## Design Decision
While we designing Hehe, we made the following decisions:

- The language is statically typed, meaning that variable types must be declared before they are used.
- Variables can only be assigned values of the same type. For example, an integer variable cannot be assigned a string value.
- We chose to use curly braces to delimit blocks of code, as they are easy to read and commonly used in other programming languages.
- We chose to use the if statement for conditional branching and the while statement for loops, as they are simple and widely used constructs.
- We chose to use '&', '|', and '!' for logical operators, as they are commonly used in other programming languages and are intuitive.
- We chose to use print and scan statements for input/output, as they are easy to understand and commonly used in other programming languages.
- We chose to use the BNF grammar notation to specify the syntax of the language, as it is a standard notation used in language design.

 ## Variable Declarations and Assignments 

 - Variables in heh are declared using the following syntax:
```
<type> <identifier> "=" <literal> ";"
```
- Here, <type> is one of the supported types (int, float, char, string, or bool), <identifier> represents a name for the variable (it must start with a letter and can contain letters, digits, and underscores), <literal> denotes a value of the specified type, and ";" serves as the statement terminator.
- integer
```
numi x = 1;
```
- float
```
numf y = 3.14;
```
- char
```
strc letter = 'Z';
```
- string
```
str greeting = "Hello,Akdeniz University!";
```
- boolean
```
tf is_false = false;
```
- To assign a value to an existing variable, use the following syntax:
```
<identifier> "=" <expression> ";"
```
- Here, <identifier> represents the name of the variable, <expression> denotes an arithmetic or logical expression that evaluates to the same type as the variable, and ";" serves as the statement terminator.
- For example,to assign a new value to the variable x, you can write:
```
x = 13;
```

## Other Features
- Hehe allows you to add comments to your code using the '--' syntax. Any text that follows '--' on a line is ignored by the compiler."
```
--this is a comment
numi x=13; --this is another comment
--this is another comment
 ```
- Hehe allows conditional statements in the form of if statements.The basic syntax is like that:
 ```
if (<expression>) <statement> [else <statement>]
 ```
- Here, <expression> represents a logical condition that determines whether to execute the subsequent <statement>. If <expression> evaluates to true, the first <statement> is executed. If <expression> evaluates to false and an else clause is present, the second <statement> is executed instead.
 ```
numi x = 5 ;
tf is_positive;
if(x > 0 ){
tf=true;
print( tf + " x is positive ");
}else {
print(tf + " x is negative ")
}
 ```
- Hehe supports while loops, which repeatedly execute a block of statements as long as a specified condition remains true. The basic syntax is:
```
  while (x < 13) {
  x = x + 1;
  print(x);
     }
```
- Also Hehe supports for loops, which iterate over a sequence of elements and execute a block of statements for each element. The basic syntax is:
```
for(numi i = 0; i<13 & i>0; i++){
    print(i);
}
```
- Hehe allows you to define and call functions.fnc keyword is used to define a function.
```
  numi fnc method(numi a, numi b){
    ret a + b;
}
```
- Hehe supports two basic input/output statements: print and scan.
```
print("hehe will be the best programming language because we developed that :) ")
```

## Conclusion
- Hehe is a straightforward programming language crafted for simplicity in learning and application. It encompasses fundamental programming structures including variables, functions, conditional statements, loops, and input/output operations.
